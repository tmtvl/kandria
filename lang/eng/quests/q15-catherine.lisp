| Hey, {(nametag player)}.
~ player
- Islay needs to talk to you urgently.
  ~ catherine
  | (:concerned)Oh, okay.
- You ready for another adventure?
  ~ catherine
  | (:excited)With you? Always!
- Looks like the old team is getting back together.
  ~ catherine
  | What, you and I?
  | (:excited)What's the plan?

~ catherine

~ player
| Come with me to \"Engineering\"(orange).

~ fi
| (:annoyed)Islay's gone. I couldn't stop her.
| She said the only way to be sure was if she checked the bombs herself.
~ player
- What?!
- She's too old.
  ~ fi
  | She might surprise you.
- Then she's dead.
  ~ fi
  | She might surprise you.
~ catherine
| (:concerned)Islay...
~ fi
| She did design the bombs, so if anyone can fix them it's her.
~ player
- We should go after her.
  ~ fi
  | (:unsure)I'm afraid I agree. She'll have better luck fixing it with your help.
  | Even though she said not to follow.
- Did she say anything else?
  ~ fi
  | (:unsure)She said not to follow.
  | But I think she'll have better luck fixing it with your help.
- What now?
  ~ fi
  | (:unsure)I'm afraid you need to go after her - even though she said not to follow.
  | She'll have better luck fixing it with your help.
~ catherine
| Then let's go!
~ fi
| Is your FFCS working?
~ player
| \"Checking FFCS...\"(light-gray, italic)
| No. \"Wraw interference\"(orange).
~ fi
| Then \"take this walkie. Try calling her once you're down there\"(orange), find out where she is.
